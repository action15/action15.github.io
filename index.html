<img align=right src="img/action-clapboard.png">			  <h3>About</h3>

<p>A repeated complaint in software analytics is that industrial practitioners find it hard to apply the results generated from data science. This is a pressing issue: actionable analytics are required to enable time- sensitive, environmental-aware decision making in software project planning. How can we bridge the gap between the predictions we can generate about software projects to actions that users can apply?
<p>Interested topics include but not limited to:
  <ul>
    <li>Experiences and lessons learned on the strengths and limitations of current software predictive models; (i.e. how reliable are existing methods?)
<li>Challenges and barriers to adopt current models and methodologies in the context of new software technolgies, such as crowdsourcing, architecture migration, cloud service compisition, etc.
<li> Roles of automation in improving predictive power in software estimation.
<li> New metrics and models to better measure, search and recommend the underlying casual relationships of cost, schedule, and quality, etc.
<li> Trends and needs of emergent software planning practices and impact on software estimation research;
			    <li> Research agenda for maturing and enriching software planning decision models.
			    </ul>
			    <h3>Goals</h3>
			    <ul>
			      <li>
				Exchange research work on exploring new ideas, metrics, and algorithms in software prediction;
<li>Discuss emergent challenges in software prediction;
<li>Propose and ideally converge on a research roadmap
  for the next 5-10 year.
  </ul>

<h3>Formatting papers</h3>
<p>Page lengths:
			 <ul><li>Full papers: max 10 pages (+2 pages refs)
			    <li>Vision statements: max 4 pages (including refs)</ul>
			      
  <p>All submissions must come in PDF format and conform, at the time of submission, to the
    <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Formatting Guidelines</a>. Authors should use the US letter style. LaTeX users should declare their document class as
<pre>
    \documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
</pre>
<p>
The compsoc option is not to be used.
