-----------------------------------------------------

A repeated complaint in software analytics is that
industrial practitioners find it hard to apply the
results generated from data science. This is a
pressing issue: actionable analytics are required to
enable time- ensitive, environmental-aware decision
making. How can we bridge the gap between the
predictions we can generate to actions that users
can apply?

The workshop goal is to:

* Exchange research work on exploring new ideas,
  metrics, and algorithms in software prediction;
* Discuss emergent challenges in software
  prediction;
* Propose and ideally converge on a research road
  map for the next 5-10 year.

Accordingly, we ask for papers on related topics
that include (but are not limited to) the following:

* Experiences and lessons learned on the strengths
  and limitations of current software predictive
  models; (i.e. how reliable are existing methods?)
* Challenges and barriers to adopt current models
  and methodologies in the context of new software
  technologies, such as crowdsourcing, architecture
  migration, cloud service composition, etc.
* Roles of automation in improving predictive power
  in software estimation.
* New metrics and models to better measure, search
  and recommend the underlying causal relationships
  of cost, schedule, and quality, etc.
* Trends and needs of emergent software planning
  practices and impact on software estimation
  research;
* Research agenda for maturing and enriching software
  planning decision models.
